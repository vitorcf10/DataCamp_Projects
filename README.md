# DataCamp_Projects
Repo containing all my projects developed at datacamp.com
In this readme.md I will write a little bit more about each project individually, in order to inform profile visitors.

- Project: Design a Banking Marketing Database
This project was completely developed in python, a bank_marketing.csv file was given and the goal was to clean the data, manipulate data with pandas and split the original csv file into three other files client.csv, campaign.csv and economics.csv. After that create python strings that store each csv in a database using SQL.
